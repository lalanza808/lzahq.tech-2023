My name is Lance. Online I go by **lza_menace** or just **Lza**. I am a California native and work in technology doing all sorts of silly stuff, most of which sounds non-sensical to those not familiar; DevOps, SRE, Platform engineering, AWS Cloud, CI/CD, full-stack software engineering, etc. 

I like to cook and bake, skateboard, write code, shitpost, and do crypto things. This is the place where I intend to about things like I know what I'm talking about. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
