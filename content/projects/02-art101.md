Art101 was a free-to-mint, Ethereum based, crypto-art/NFT project in collaboration with [@cartyisme](https://twitter.com/cartyisme) and [@jwinterm](https://twitter.com/j_winter_m). Our free mints were a no-influencer, no-shill, principled affair with an organic and grassroots following. 

Our focus on arts education and accessibility stood in stark contrast to the shady cash-grabbing free-for-all that was the NFT moon mission.

We completed nine generative collections over 18 months amid the 2022 bear market and ended with over 30,000 NFTs minted, 2.5M+ USD in volume traded, and 189ETH in TX fees.
