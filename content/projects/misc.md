Over the years in my professional career I've done a lot of tying it into personal projects;
much of it pertained to DevOps and cloud related topics. AWS, Terraform, BASH & Python scripting, some Rust web services, Ansible/Chef config mgmt stuff, etc.

I have always done open source projects in my personal projects, much of that can be found in my repos/accounts listed below.
